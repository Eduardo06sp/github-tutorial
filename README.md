# github-tutorial

For us to work effectively, we'll need to make use of Git/Github. This repository serves as a sort of playground allowing you to learn by doing.

## Prerequisites

It would be helpful for you to complete this tutorial:
https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1

You'll also need git installed on your machine. Follow the instructions here to get this set up: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

But don't worry, we'll also help you along the way.

## Instructions

First, you need to `fork` this repository. You can find that on the top of this page, right under your profile picture.

After you fork this repository, you'll need to get it set up on your local environment. This is accomplished via `git clone`, with the command line. In your repository, you'll find a green button that says "clone or download". Click that, and copy the URL.

Now, in your terminal, where you've installed git, type `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/github-tutorial.git`
